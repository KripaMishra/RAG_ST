How do I handle “Errors were encountered while processing: glx-diversions”? 16.\n- If the GPU used for display is an NVIDIA GPU, the X server configuration file, /etc/X11/xorg.conf, may need to be modified. In some cases, nvidia-xconfig can be used to automatically generate an xorg.conf file that works for the system. For non-standard systems, such as those with more than one GPU, it is recommended to manually edit the xorg.conf file. Consult the xorg.conf documentation for more information. Note Installing Mesa may overwrite the /usr/lib/libGL.so that was previously installed by the NVIDIA driver, so a reinstallation of the NVIDIA driver might be required after installing these libraries. Reboot the system to reload the graphical interface: sudo reboot Verify the device nodes are created properly. Perform the post-installation actions. 8.3.
