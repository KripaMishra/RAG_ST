       "'nvJPEG A GPU accelerated JPEG codec library. The nvJPEG library provides high-performance, GPU accelerated JPEG decoding functionality for image formats commonly used in deep learning and hyperscale multimedia applications. The library offers single and batched JPEG decoding capabilities which efficiently utilize the available GPU resources for optimum performance; and the flexibility for users to manage the memory allocation needed for decoding. The nvJPEG library enables the following functions: use the JPEG image data stream as input; retrieve the width and height of the image from the data stream, and use this retrieved information to manage the GPU memory allocation and the decoding. A dedicated API is provided for retrieving the image information from the raw JPEG image data stream. Note Throughout this document, the terms “CPU” and “Host” are used synonymously. Similarly, the terms “GPU” and “Device” are synonymous. The nvJPEG library supports the following: JPEG options: Baseline and Progressive JPEG decoding/encoding 8 bits per pixel Huffman bitstream decoding Upto 4 channel JPEG bitstreams 8- and 16-bit quantization tables The following chroma subsampling for the 3 color channels Y, Cb, Cr (Y, U, V): 4:4:4 4:2:2 4:2:0 4:4:0 4:1:1 4:1:0 Features: Hybrid decoding using both the CPU (i.e., host) and the GPU (i.e., device). Hardware acceleration for baseline JPEG decode on  supported platforms . Input to the library is in the host memory, and the output is in the GPU memory. Single image and batched image decoding. Single phase and multiple phases decoding. Color space conversion. User-provided memory manager for the device and pinned host memory allocations. The encoding functions of the nvJPEG library perform GPU-accelerated compression of user’s image data to the JPEG bitstream. User can provide input data in a number of formats and colorspaces, and control the encoding process with parameters. Encoding functionality will allocate temporary buffers using user-provided memory allocator. Before calling the encoding functions the user should perform a few prerequisite steps using the helper functions described in  nvJPEG Encoder Helper API Reference . Not all nvJPEG types are thread safe. When using decoder APIs across multiple threads, the following decoder types should be instantiated separately for each thread:  nvjpegJpegStream_t ,  nvjpegJpegState_t ,  nvjpegBufferDevice_t ,  nvjpegBufferPinned_t When using encoder APIs across multiple threads,  nvjpegEncoderState_t  should be instantiated separately for each thread. For user-provided allocators (inputs to  nvJPEGCreateEx() ), the user needs to ensure thread safety. The nvJPEG states and handles are bound to the device that was set as current during their creation. Using these states and handles with another device set as current is undefined. The user is responsible of keeping track of the current device. Hardware accelerated JPEG decode is available on the following GPUs - A100, A30, H100. Platforms which support hardware accelerated JPEG decode: Windows Linux (x86_64, PowerPC, ARM64) \\u200bThe nvJPEG library provides functions for both the decoding of a single image, and batched decoding of multiple images. For single-image decoding you provide the data size and a pointer to the file data, and the decoded image is placed in the output buffer. To use the nvJPEG library, start by calling the helper functions for initialization. Create nvJPEG library handle with one of the helper functions  nvjpegCreateSimple()   or   nvjpegCreateEx() . Create JPEG state with the helper function  nvjpegJpegStateCreate() . See  nvJPEG Type Declarations  and  nvjpegJpegStateCreate() . The following helper functions are available in the nvJPEG library: nvjpegStatus_t   nvjpegGetProperty(libraryPropertyType   type,   int   *value); [DEPRECATED]   nvjpegStatus_t   nvjpegCreate(nvjpegBackend_t   backend,   nvjpegHandle_t   *handle   ,   nvjpeg_dev_allocator   allocator); nvjpegStatus_t   nvjpegCreateSimple(nvjpegHandle_t   *handle); nvjpegStatus_t   nvjpegCreateEx(nvjpegBackend_t   backend,   nvjpegDevAllocator_t   *dev_allocator,   nvjpegPinnedAllocator_t   *pinned_allocator,   unsigned   int   flags,   nvjpegHandle_t   *handle); nvjpegStatus_t   nvjpegDestroy(nvjpegHandle_t   handle); nvjpegStatus_t   nvjpegJpegStateCreate(nvjpegHandle_t   handle,   nvjpegJpegState_t   *jpeg_handle); nvjpegStatus_t   nvjpegJpegStateDestroy(nvjpegJpegState   handle); Other helper functions such as  nvjpegSet*()  and  nvjpegGet*()  can be used to configure the library functionality on per-handle basis. Refer to the  helper API reference  for more details. Retrieve the width and height information from the JPEG-encoded image by using the  nvjpegGetImageInfo()  function. Below is the signature of  nvjpegGetImageInfo() function: For each image to be decoded, pass the JPEG data pointer and data length to the above function. The  nvjpegGetImageInfo()  function is thread safe. One of the outputs of the above  nvjpegGetImageInfo()  function is  nvjpegChromaSubsampling_t . This parameter is an enum type, and its enumerator list is composed of the chroma subsampling property retrieved from the JPEG image. See  nvJPEG Chroma Subsampling . Use the  nvjpegDecode()  function in the nvJPEG library to decode this single JPEG image. See the signature of this function below: In the above  nvjpegDecode()  function, the parameters  nvjpegOutputFormat_t ,  nvjpegImage_t , and  cudaStream_t  can be used to set the output behavior of the  nvjpegDecode() function. You provide the  cudaStream_t  parameter to indicate the stream to which your asynchronous tasks are submitted. The ``nvjpegOutputFormat_t`` parameter: The  nvjpegOutputFormat_t  parameter can be set to one of the  output_format  settings below: output_format Meaning NVJPEG_OUTPUT_UNCHANGED Return the decoded image planar format. NVJPEG_OUTPUT_RGB Convert to planar RGB. NVJPEG_OUTPUT_BGR Convert to planar BGR. NVJPEG_OUTPUT_RGBI Convert to interleaved RGB. NVJPEG_OUTPUT_BGRI Convert to interleaved BGR. NVJPEG_OUTPUT_Y Return the Y component only. NVJPEG_OUTPUT_YUV Return in the YUV planar format. NVJPEG_OUTPUT_UNCHANGEDI_U16 Return the decoded image interleaved format. For example, if  output_format  is set to  NVJPEG_OUTPUT_Y  or  NVJPEG_OUTPUT_RGBI , or  NVJPEG_OUTPUT_BGRI  then the output is written only to channel[0] of  nvjpegImage_t , and the other channels are not touched. Alternately, in the case of planar output, the data is written to the corresponding channels of the  nvjpegImage_t  destination structure. Finally, in the case of grayscale JPEG and RGB output, the luminance is used to create the grayscale RGB. The below table explains the combinations of the output formats and the number of channels supported by the library. No of Channels in bitstream 1 2 3 4 Output Format NVJPEG_OUTPUT_UNCHANGED Yes Yes Yes Yes NVJPEG_OUTPUT_YUV Only the first channel of the output is populated No Yes No NVJPEG_OUTPUT_Y Yes No Yes Yes (a) NVJPEG_OUTPUT_RGB Yes (b) No Yes Yes (a) NVJPEG_OUTPUT_BGR Yes (b) No Yes Yes (a) NVJPEG_OUTPUT_RGBI Yes (b) No Yes Yes (a) NVJPEG_OUTPUT_BGRI Yes (b) No Yes Yes (a) NVJPEG_OUTPUT_UNCHANGEDI_U16 Yes(c) Yes No No NOTES: Must be enabled using  nvjpegDecodeParamsSetAllowCMYK() . Luminance is used to create the grayscale RGB. Supported only by  NVJPEG_BACKEND_LOSSLESS_JPEG  backend. As mentioned above, an important benefit of the  nvjpegGetImageInfo() function is the ability to utilize the image information retrieved from the the input JPEG image to allocate proper GPU memory for your decoding operation. The  nvjpegGetImageInfo()  function returns the  widths ,  heights  and  nComponents  parameters. You can use the retrieved parameters,  widths ,  heights  and  nComponents , to calculate the required size for the output buffers, either for a single decoded JPEG, or for every decoded JPEG in a batch. To optimally set the  destination  parameter for the  nvjpegDecode()  function, use the following guidelines: For the output_format: NVJPEG_OUTPUT_Y destination.pitch[0] should be at least:  width[0] destination.channel[0] should be at least of size:  destination.pitch[0]*height[0] For the output_format destination.pitch[c] should be at least: destination.channel[c] should be at least of size: NVJPEG_OUTPUT_YUV width[c] for c = 0, 1, 2 destination.pitch[c]*height[c] for c = 0, 1, 2 NVJPEG_OUTPUT_RGB and NVJPEG_OUTPUT_BGR width[0] for c = 0, 1, 2 destination.pitch[0]*height[0] for c = 0, 1, 2 NVJPEG_OUTPUT_RGBI and NVJPEG_OUTPUT_BGRI width[0]*3 destination.pitch[0]*height[0] NVJPEG_OUTPUT_UNCHANGED width[c] for c = [ 0, nComponents - 1 ] destination.pitch[c]*height[c] for c = [ 0, nComponents - 1] NVJPEG_OUTPUT_UNCHANGEDI_U16 width[c]* nComponents* sizeof(unsigned short) destination.pitch[c]*height[c] for c = [ 0, nComponents - 1] Ensure that the  nvjpegImage_t  structure (or structures, in the case of batched decode) is filled with the pointers and pitches of allocated buffers. The  nvjpegImage_t  structure that holds the output pointers is defined as follows: NVJPEG_MAX_COMPONENT is the maximum number of color components the nvJPEG library supports in the current release. For generic images, this is the maximum number of encoded channels that the library is able to decompress. Finally, when you call the  nvjpegDecode()  function with the parameters as described above, the  nvjpegDecode()  function fills the output buffers with the decoded data. The nvJPEG library allows further separation of the host and device phases of the decode process. The host phase of the decoding will not need to access to device resources. A few examples of decoupled APIs can be found under  Decode API - Decoupled Decoding. Below is the sequence of API calls to decode a single image Initialize all the items that are used in the decoding process: Create the library handle using one of the library handle initialization routines. Choose decoder implementation  nvjpegBackend_t , and create decoder using  nvjpegDecoderCreate() . Create JPEG decoder state using  nvjpegDecoderStateCreate() . Create JPEG stream using  nvjpegJpegStreamCreate() . Create the pinned and device buffers used by the decoder using the below APIs respectively. These buffers are used to store intermediate decoding results. nvjpegBufferPinnedCreate() nvjpegBufferDeviceCreate() Link the buffers to the JPEG state using the following APIs respectively: nvjpegStateAttachPinnedBuffer() nvjpegStateAttachDeviceBuffer() Create decode parameters using the below API. This is used to set the output format, and enable ROI decode: nvjpegDecodeParamsCreate() Perform decoding: Parse the jpeg bit-stream using  nvjpegJpegStreamParse() Encoded bitstream information, like channel dimensions, can be retrieved using the below API. This information is used to allocate the output pointers in  nvjpegImage_t . nvjpegJpegStreamGetComponentsNum() nvjpegJpegStreamGetComponentDimensions() Call the decode API in the below sequence to decode the image: nvjpegDecodeJpegHost() nvjpegDecodeJpegTransferToDevice() nvjpegDecodeJpegDevice() For the batched image decoding you provide pointers to multiple file data in the memory, and also provide the buffer sizes for each file data. The nvJPEG library will decode these multiple images, and will place the decoded data in the output buffers that you specified in the parameters. For batched image decoding in single phase, follow these steps: Call  nvjpegDecodeBatchedInitialize()  function to initialize the batched decoder. Specify the batch size in the  batch_size  parameter. See  nvjpegDecodeBatchedInitialize() . Next, call  nvjpegDecodeBatched()  for each new batch. Make sure to pass the parameters that are correct to the specific batch of images. If the size of the batch changes, or if the batch decoding fails, then call the  nvjpegDecodeBatchedInitialize()  function again. The  nvjpegBackend_t  enum is used to select either default back-end by default, or use GPU decoding for baseline JPEG images, or use CPU for Huffman decoding. Member Description NVJPEG_BACKEND_DEFAULT Back-end is selected internally. NVJPEG_BACKEND_HYBRID Uses CPU for Huffman decoding. NVJPEG_BACKEND_GPU_HYBRID Uses GPU for Huffman decoding.  nvjpegDecodeBatched  will use GPU decoding for baseline JPEG images with interleaved scan when batch size is greater than 50. The  decoupled APIs  will use GPU assisted Huffman decoding. NVJPEG_BACKEND_HARDWARE Uses  Hardware Acceleration  for decode. Supports baseline JPEG images with single scan with 1 or 3 channels. 410 and 411 chroma subsamplings are not supported. NVJPEG_BACKEND_GPU_HYBRID_DEVICE Supports input bitstream on device memory. Can be used only with batched decode APIs for baseline JPEG images without restart intervals. NVJPEG_BACKEND_HARDWARE_DEVICE Supports input bitstream on device memory. Can be used only with batched decode APIs. Uses  Hardware Acceleration  for decode. Supports baseline JPEG images with single scan with 1 or 3 channels. 410 and 411 chroma subsamplings are not supported. NVJPEG_BACKEND_LOSSLESS_JPEG Supports lossless jpeg bitstreams as defined in the jpeg 92 standard. Bitstreams with up to 2 channels and prediction mode 1 are supported. This handle stores the bit-stream parameters on the host. This helps retrieve bitstream meta-data using APIs defined in  nvJPEG Stream API . This  nvjpegBufferDevice_t  is used by decoder states to store the intermediate information in device memory. This decoder parameter handle stores the parameters like output format, and the ROI decode parameters that are set using APIs defined in  nvJPEG Chroma Subsampling . This  nvjpegBufferPinned_t  handle is used by decoder states to store the intermediate information on pinned memory. This decoder handle stores the intermediate decoder data, which is shared across the decoding stages. This decoder handle is initialized for a given  nvjpegBackend_t . It is used as input to the  Decode API—Decoupled Decoding . When the  nvjpegPinnedAllocator_t   *allocator  parameter in the  nvjpegCreateEx()  function is set as a pointer to the above  nvjpegPinnedAllocator_t  structure, then this structure will be used for allocating and releasing host pinned memory for copying data to/from device. The function prototypes for the memory allocation and memory freeing functions are similar to the  cudaHostAlloc()  and  cudaFreeHost()  functions. They will return 0 in case of success, and non-zero otherwise. However, if the  nvjpegPinnedAllocator_t   *allocator  parameter in the  nvjpegCreateEx()  function is set to NULL, then the default memory allocation functions  cudaHostAlloc()  and  cudaFreeHost()  will be used. When using  nvjpegCreate()  or  nvjpegCreateSimple()  function to create library handle, the default host pinned memory allocator will be used. Extended pinned allocators support stream ordered allocations along with user defined context information  pinned_ctx . When invoking the allocators, nvJPEG will pass  pinned_ctx  as input to the extended pinned allocators. The  nvjpegImage_t  structure (or structures, in the case of batched decode) is used to fill with the pointers and pitches of allocated buffers. The  nvjpegImage_t  structure that holds the output pointers. Member Description NVJPEG_MAX_COMPONENT Maximum number of color components the nvJPEG library supports. For generic images, this is the maximum number of encoded channels that the library is able to decompress. Users can tell the library to use their own device memory allocator. The function prototypes for the memory allocation and memory freeing functions are similar to the  cudaMalloc() and  cudaFree()  functions. They should return 0 in case of success, and non-zero otherwise. A pointer to the  nvjpegDevAllocator_t  structure, with properly filled fields, should be provided to the  nvjpegCreate()  function. NULL is accepted, in which case the default memory allocation functions  cudaMalloc()  and  cudaFree()  is used. When the  nvjpegDevAllocator_t   *allocator  parameter in the  nvjpegCreate()  or  nvjpegCreateEx()  function is set as a pointer to the above  nvjpegDevAllocator_t  structure, then this structure is used for allocating and releasing the device memory. The function prototypes for the memory allocation and memory freeing functions are similar to the  cudaMalloc()  and  cudaFree()  functions. They should return 0 in case of success, and non-zero otherwise. However, if the  nvjpegDevAllocator_t   *allocator  parameter in the  nvjpegCreate()  or  nvjpegCreateEx()  function is set to NULL, then the default memory allocation functions  cudaMalloc()  and  cudaFree()  will be used. When using  nvjpegCreateSimple()  function to create library handle the default device memory allocator will be used. Extended device allocators support stream ordered allocations along with user defined context information  dev_ctx . When invoking the allocators, nvJPEG will pass  dev_ctx  as input to the extended device allocators. The  nvjpegJpegState  structure stores the temporary JPEG information. It should be initialized before any usage. This JPEG state handle can be reused after being used in another decoding. The same JPEG handle should be used across the decoding phases for the same image or batch. Multiple threads are allowed to share the JPEG state handle only when processing same batch during first phase ( nvjpegDecodePhaseOne ) . The library handle is used in any consecutive nvJPEG library calls, and should be initialized first. The library handle is thread safe, and can be used by multiple threads simultaneously. The  nvjpegImage_t struct holds the pointers to the output buffers, and holds the corresponding strides of those buffers for the image decoding. See  Single Image Decoding  on how to set up the  nvjpegImage_t  struct. The  nvjpegJpegEncoding_t  enum lists the JPEG encoding types that are supported by the nvJPEG library The enum values are based on the markers defined in the JPEG specification Member Description NVJPEG_ENCODING_UNKNOWN This value is returned for all the JPEG markers not supported by the nvJPEG library. NVJPEG_ENCODING_BASELINE_DCT Corresponds to the JPEG marker 0xc0, refer to the JPEG spec for more details. NVJPEG_ENCODING_EXTENDED_SEQUENTIAL_DCT_HUFFMAN Corresponds to the JPEG marker 0xc1, refer to the JPEG spec for more details. NVJPEG_ENCODING_PROGRESSIVE_DCT_HUFFMAN Corresponds to the JPEG marker 0xc2, refer to the JPEG spec for more details. NVJPEG_ENCODING_LOSSLESS_HUFFMAN Corresponds to the JPEG marker 0xc3, refer to the JPEG spec for more details. The  nvjpegScaleFactor_t  enum lists all the scale factors supported by the library. This feature is supported when nvjpeg handles are intstaniated using NVJPEG_BACKEND_HARDWARE Member Description NVJPEG_SCALE_NONE Decoded output is not scaled NVJPEG_SCALE_1_BY_2 Decoded output width and height are scaled by a factor of 1/2 NVJPEG_SCALE_1_BY_4 Decoded output width and height are scaled by a factor of 1/4 NVJPEG_SCALE_1_BY_8 Decoded output width and height are scaled by a factor of 1/8 nvJPEG flags provide additional controls when initializing the library using  nvJPEGCreateEx()  or  nvJPEGCreateExV2()  . It is possible to combine the flags as they are bit fields. Member Description NVJPEG_FLAGS_DEFAULT Corresponds to default library behavior. NVJPEG_FLAGS_HW_DECODE_NO_PIPELINE To be used when the library is initialized with NVJPEG_BACKEND_HARDWARE. It will be ignored for other back-ends. nvjpeg in batched decode mode buffers additional images to achieve optimal performance. Use this flag to disable buffering of additional images. NVJPEG_FLAGS_ENABLE_MEMORY_POOLS [Deprecated] Starting with CUDA 11.1 this flag will be ignored. NVJPEG_FLAGS_BITSTREAM_STRICT nvJPEG library will try to decode a bitstream even if it doesn’t strictly follow the JPEG specification. Using this flag will return an error in such cases. NVJPEG_FLAGS_REDUCED_MEMORY_DECODE When using  NVJPEG_BACKEND_HYBRID  or  NVJPEG_BACKEND_GPU_HYBRID  backends, enabling this flag will reduce the memory usage of the decoding whenever possible. NVJPEG_FLAGS_REDUCED_MEMORY_DECODE_ZERO_COPY Using this flag enables zero-copy memory when feasible on supported platforms. NVJPEG_FLAGS_UPSAMPLING_WITH_INTERPOLATION Using this flag enables the decoder to use interpolation when performing chroma upsampling during the YCbCr to RGB conversion stage. The  nvjpegExifOrientation_t  enum represents the exif orientation in a jfif(jpeg) file. Exif orientation information is typically used to denote the digital camera sensor orientation at the time of image capture. Member Description NVJPEG_ORIENTATION_UNKNOWN Exif orientation information is not available in the bitstream. NVJPEG_ORIENTATION_NORMAL Decode output remains unchanged. NVJPEG_ORIENTATION_FLIP_HORIZONTAL Decoded output should be mirrored/flipped horizontally. NVJPEG_ORIENTATION_ROTATE_180 Decoded output should be rotated 180 degrees. NVJPEG_ORIENTATION_FLIP_VERTICAL Decoded output should be mirrored/flipped vertically. NVJPEG_ORIENTATION_TRANSPOSE Decoded output should be flipped/mirrored horizontally followed by a 90 degrees counter-clockwise rotation. NVJPEG_ORIENTATION_ROTATE_90 Decoded output should be rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. NVJPEG_ORIENTATION_TRANSVERSE Decoded output should be flipped/mirrored horizontally followed by a 270 degrees counter-clockwise rotation. NVJPEG_ORIENTATION_ROTATE_270 Decoded output should be rotated 270 degrees counter-clockwise. This section describes the nvJPEG decoder API.

Returns: nvjpegStatus_t  — An error code as specified in  nvJPEG API Return Codes . This is an experimental API that can be used with  nvjpegDecodeBatched . When decoding images with varying sizes and chroma subsampling, performance is limited by the repeated cuda calls made by the library to free/allocate device memory. This API attempts to avoid this problem by allocating device memory prior to the actual decoding. Users have the option to call this API with values that are unlikely to be exceeded when  nvjpegDecodeBatched  is called. Note Note:\\nThis functionality is available only when the  nvjpegHandle_t is instantiated using NVJPEG_BACKEND_HARDWARE. It is currently a No Op for other backends. This API only provides a hint for initial allocation. If the image dimensions at the time of decode exceed what was provided, then the library will resize the device buffers. If the images being decoded have different chroma subsamplings, then the  chroma_subsampling  field should be set to NVJPEG_CSS_444 to ensure that the device memory can be reused. Signature: Parameters: Parameter Input / Output Memory Description nvjpegHandle_t   handle Input Host The library handle. nvjpegJpegState_t   jpeg_handle Input Host The image state handle. int   batch_size Input Host Batch size. int   width Input Host Maximum width of image that will be decoded. int   height Input Host Maximum height of image that will be decoded. nvjpegChromaSubsampling_t   chroma_subsampling Input Host Chroma-subsampling of the images. nvjpegOutputFormat_t   output_format Input Host Format in which the decoded output will be saved.

Can be set to NULL to reset the jpeg tables. size_t   length Input Host JPEG tables bitstream size. Returns: nvjpegStatus_t  — An error code as specified in  nvJPEG API Return Codes . This set of decoding API works with the bitstream handles, decode parameter handles, pinned and device buffers handles as input, thus decoupling JPEG bitstream parse, buffer management and setting up decoder parameters from the decode process itself. Currently only multiphase decoding is available. Multiphase decoupled single image decoding consists of three phases: Host Mixed Device Each of the above decodings is carried on according to its individual semantics. Phases on different images can be carried out with different decoding state handles simultaneously, while sharing of some helper objects is possible. See the details of semantics in the individual phases descriptions. Below are a couple of examples of using decoupled API. The following snippet explains how to use the API to prefetch the host stage of the processing: first do all of the host work on the host, and then submit the rest of decoding work to the device. The following snippet explains how pinned and device buffers can be shared across two instances of  nvJPEG Decoder Handle . This is the first stage of the decoupled decoding process. It is done entirely on the host, hence it is synchronous with respect to the host. If a pinned buffer is attached to the decoder state, then the pinned buffer object will be used to allocate the pinned memory required for the host decoding phase. There wouldn’t be allocation if the pinned buffer object already handles the required amount of pinned memory. If a pinned buffer object is not attached, then the state will use heap host memory to allocate the memory required for the host processing. In this phase, device is not participating. Hence the device selection, device initialization, and device memory initialization can be done later in the decoding process. This function works on a parsed stream. The parsed stream handle that is available after calling the  nvjpegJpegStreamParse()  function should be provided to this function. Signature: Parameters: Parameter Input / Output Memory Description nvjpegHandle_t   handle Input Host The library handle. nvjpegJpegDecoder_t   decoder Input Host The nvJPEG decoder handle. nvjpegJpegState_t   decoder_state Input Host The nvJPEG decoder state handle. nvjpegDecodeParams_t   decode_params Input Host Handle to decode the output properties. nvjpegJpegStream_t   jpeg_stream Input Host Handle to the parsed bitstream data. Returns: nvjpegStatus_t  — An error code as specified in  nvJPEG API Return Codes . This phase contains both host and device operations. Hence it is a mix of synchronous and asynchronous operations with respect to the host. All the device operations will be submitted to the provided stream. This phase should be called only after the host phase with the same decoder handle, decoder state handle and parsed jpeg stream handle. Device should be initialized and device buffer should be attached to  decoder_state  handle using  nvjpegStateAttachDeviceBuffer()  prior to calling this API. This device buffer object will be resized to the required amount of memory if needed. For the host memory buffer, this phase will use whatever was used in the host phase: either the attached pinned buffer or the state’s host memory buffer. Signature: Parameters: Parameter Input / Output Memory Description nvjpegHandle_t   handle Input Host The library handle. nvjpegJpegDecoder_t   decoder Input Host The nvJPEG decoder handle. nvjpegJpegState_t   decoder_state Input Host The nvJPEG decoder state handle. nvjpegJpegStream_t   jpeg_stream Input Host Handle to the parsed bitstream data. cudaStream_t   stream Input Host The CUDA stream to which all the GPU tasks will be submitted. Returns: nvjpegStatus_t  — An error code as specified in  nvJPEG API Return Codes . This phase consists of decode operations that take place mainly on the device (no significant host side computation is done). Hence this phase is asynchronous with respect to the host. This phase should be called after  nvjpegDecodeJpegTransferToDevice()  for a given  decoder_state  handle and decoder handle. In this function call, the host memory buffers are not used, so if the pinned buffer was attached to the state, then it can be reused somewhere else. Note that at this point the Jpeg stream handle is not needed anymore, since parts that are needed for device decoding will be copied to the device memory in the previous phase. Signature: Parameters: Parameter Input / Output Memory Description nvjpegHandle_t   handle Input Host The library handle. nvjpegJpegDecoder_t   decoder Input Host The nvJPEG decoder handle. nvjpegJpegState_t   decoder_state Input Host The nvJPEG decoder state handle. nvjpegImage_t   *destination Input/Output Host/Device Pointer to a structure that describes the output destination. This structure should be on host, but the pointers in this structure should be pointing to the device memory. See  nvJPEG Image  for details. cudaStream_t   stream Input Host The CUDA stream to which all the GPU tasks will be submitted. Returns: nvjpegStatus_t  — An error code as specified in  nvJPEG API Return Codes . This is a single phase API with the flexibility to select nvJPEG back-end when creating an  nvjpegJpegDecoder_t  object. The user has the option to call this API instead of making three separate calls to  nvjpegDecodeJpegHost() ,  nvjpegDecodeJpegTransferToDevice() , and  nvjpegDecodeJpegDevice() . It is required to atttach the device buffer to the decoder state before calling this API. The pinned buffer is optional. If the pinned buffer is not attached, then heap memory will be used for host processing. This function works on a parsed stream. The parsed stream handle that is available after calling the  nvjpegJpegStreamParse()  function should be provided to this function. Signature: Parameters: Parameter Input / Output Memory Description nvjpegHandle_t   handle Input Host The library handle. nvjpegJpegDecoder_t   decoder Input Host The nvJPEG decoder handle. nvjpegJpegState_t   decoder_state Input Host The nvJPEG decoder state handle. nvjpegJpegStream_t   jpeg_stream Input Host Handle to the parsed bitstream data. nvjpegImage_t   *destination Input/Output Host/Device Pointer to a structure that describes the output destination. This structure should be on the host, but the pointers in this structure should be pointing to the device memory. See  nvJPEG Image  for details. nvjpegDecodeParams_t   decode_params Input Host The handle which stores the decode output properties. cudaStream_t   stream Input Host The CUDA stream to which all the GPU tasks will be submitted. Returns: nvjpegStatus_t  — An error code as specified in  nvJPEG API Return Codes . This category of APIs is used to set the decoding parameters. These APIs should be used with the decode APIs defined in  Decode API—Decoupled Decoding . This function is used to set the decode output format. See  nvjpegOutputFormat_t  described in step 6 of  Single Image Decoding . The output parameter of  nvjpegOutputFormat_t  defaults to NVJPEG_OUTPUT_UNCHANGED if not set using this API. Signature: Parameters: Parameter Input / Output Memory Description nvjpegDecodeParams_t   decode_params Input Host Decode output parameter handle. nvjpegOutputFormat_t   output_format Input Host See step 6 of  Single Image Decoding . Returns: nvjpegStatus_t  — An error code as specified in  nvJPEG API Return Codes . This function enables the region of interest-only (ROI-only) decode. To disable the ROI-only, i.e., to decode the whole image, set: offset_x  = 0, offset_y  = 0, roi_width  = -1, and roi_height  = -1. Note ROI decode is disabled by default. It is not supported when the nvJPEG decoder handle is created using NVJPEG_BACKEND_HARDWARE. The ROI window cannot go out of image bounds. That is: offset_x  cannot be lower than zero, or offset_x   +   roi_width  cannot be larger than the JPEG image width. If the output format is NVJPEG_OUTPUT_YUV or NVJPEG_OUTPUT_UNCHANGED, then the  offset_x and  offset_y  values have to be multiples of the maximum subsampling factor, as defined in the JPEG standard. Signature: Parameters: Parameter Input / Output Memory Description nvjpegDecodeParams_t   decode_params Input Host The decode output parameter handle. int   offset_x Input Host Image offset along the horizontal direction relative to the top left corner. int   offset_y Input Host Image offset along the vertical direction relative to the top left corner. int   roi_width Input Host Image width relative to  offset_x . int   roi_height Input Host Image height relative to  offset_y . Returns: nvjpegStatus_t  — An error code as specified in  nvJPEG API Return Codes . If enabled, the nvJPEG library assumes that the JPEG with 4 encoded color components is in CMYK colorspace, and enables the conversion to RGB/YUV colorspace. The CMYK-to-RGB conversion is disabled by default. The conversion is based on the subtractive scheme—this behavior matches OpenCV’s handling of 4-component JPEGs. Signature: Parameters: Parameter Input / Output Memory Description nvjpegDecodeParams_t   decode_params Input Host Decode output parameter handle. int   allow_cmyk Input Host Enable CMYK to RGB conversion. Returns: nvjpegStatus_t  — An error code as specified in  nvJPEG API Return Codes . Allows the user to scale decode output. Note This feature is currently supported only when nvJPEG decoder handle is created using NVJPEG_BACKEND_HARDWARE. Signature: Parameters: Parameter Input / Output Memory Description nvjpegDecodeParams_t   decode_params Input Host Decode output parameter handle. nvjpegScaleFactor_t   scale_factor Input Host Set the scaling factor for the decode output. The scale factor is set to NVJPEG_SCALE_NONE by default. The supported values are listed  here . When setting a scale factor value, the recommended allocation of the destination parameters is as follows: Use  nvjpegGetImageInfo() , or  nvjpegJpegStreamGetFrameDimensions()  to extract the dimensions of each channel. Let height[NVJPEG_MAX_COMPONENT] and width[NVJPEG_MAX_COMPONENT] be 2 arrays which store the height and width. The index to these arrays correspond to the channel id. For a channel c, the scaled dimensions are calculated as follows: scaled_height[c] = (height[c] + rounding_factor - 1)/rounding_factor scaled_width[c] = (width[c] + rounding_factor - 1)/rounding_factor when scale_factor = NVJPEG_SCALE_NONE, rounding_factor = 1 when scale_factor = NVJPEG_SCALE_1_BY_2, rounding_factor = 2 when scale_factor = NVJPEG_SCALE_1_BY_4, rounding_factor = 4 when scale_factor = NVJPEG_SCALE_1_BY_8, rounding_factor = 8 For the output_format: NVJPEG_OUTPUT_Y destination.pitch[0] should be at least:  width[0] destination.channel[0] should be at least of size:  destination.pitch[0]*height[0] For the output_format destination.pitch[c] should be at least: destination.channel[c] should be at least of size: NVJPEG_OUTPUT_YUV width[c] for c = 0, 1, 2 destination.pitch[c]*height[c] for c = 0, 1, 2 NVJPEG_OUTPUT_RGB and NVJPEG_OUTPUT_BGR width[0] for c = 0, 1, 2 destination.pitch[0]*height[0] for c = 0, 1, 2 NVJPEG_OUTPUT_RGBI and NVJPEG_OUTPUT_BGRI width[0]*3 destination.pitch[0]*height[0] NVJPEG_OUTPUT_UNCHANGED width[c] for c = [ 0, nComponents - 1 ] destination.pitch[c]*height[c] for c = [ 0, nComponents - 1] Returns: nvjpegStatus_t  — An error code as specified in  nvJPEG API Return Codes . This function is used to generate the decoded output based on the exif orientation parameter. When ExifOrientation is enabled, the output buffers should be allocated based on the rotated dimensions. If the orientation is set as  NVJPEG_ORIENTATION_UNKNOWN , the library will default to  NVJPEG_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL . ROI Decode and EXIF rotation Exif rotation and ROI Decode can be enabled together. The ROI coordinates should be in the rotated space. Signature: Parameters: Parameter Input / Output Memory Description nvjpegDecodeParams_t   decode_params Input Host Decode output parameter handle. nvjpegExifOrientation_t   orientation Input Host Set the exif orientation for the decode output. Returns: nvjpegStatus_t  — An error code as specified in  nvJPEG API Return Codes . The nvJPEG API adheres to the following return codes and their indicators: Description of the returned error codes: Returned Error (Returned Code) Description NVJPEG_STATUS_SUCCESS   (0) The API call has finished successfully. Note that many of the calls are asynchronous and some of the errors may be seen only after synchronization. NVJPEG_STATUS_NOT_INITIALIZED   (1) The library handle was not initialized. A call to  nvjpegCreate()  is required to initialize the handle. NVJPEG_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER   (2) Wrong parameter was passed. For example, a null pointer as input data, or an image index not in the allowed range. NVJPEG_STATUS_BAD_JPEG   (3) Cannot parse the JPEG stream. Check that the encoded JPEG stream and its size parameters are correct. NVJPEG_STATUS_JPEG_NOT_SUPPORTED   (4) Attempting to decode a JPEG stream that is not supported by the nvJPEG library. NVJPEG_STATUS_ALLOCATOR_FAILURE   (5) The user-provided allocator functions, for either memory allocation or for releasing the memory, returned a non-zero code. NVJPEG_STATUS_EXECUTION_FAILED   (6) Error during the execution of the device tasks. NVJPEG_STATUS_ARCH_MISMATCH   (7) The device capabilities are not enough for the set of input parameters provided (input parameters such as backend, encoded stream parameters, output format). NVJPEG_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR   (8) Error during the execution of the device tasks. NVJPEG_STATUS_IMPLEMENTATION_NOT_SUPPORTED   (9) Not supported. NVJPEG_STATUS_INCOMPLETE_BITSTREAM   (10) Bitstream input data incomplete One of the outputs of the  nvjpegGetImageInfo()  API is  nvjpegChromaSubsampling_t . This parameter is an  enum  type, and its enumerator list comprises of the chroma subsampling property retrieved from the encoded JPEG image. The  nvjpegGetImageInfo()  function currently supports the following chroma subsampling types: Refer to the JPEG standard:  https://jpeg.org/jpeg/ nvJPEG Decode sample can be found here:  https://github.com/NVIDIA/CUDALibrarySamples/tree/master/nvJPEG/nvJPEG-Decoder This section describes the encoding functions of the nvJPEG Library. The user should perform the below prerequisite steps before calling the nvJPEG encoding functions. See also  nvJPEG Encoder Helper API Reference . The user should create an encoding parameters structure with  nvjpegEncoderParamsCreate()  function. The function will be initialized with default parameters. User can use an appropriate  nvjpegEncoderParamsSet*()  function to set a specific parameter. The quality parameter can be set, using the  nvjpegEncoderParamsSetQuality()  function, to an integer value between 1 and 100, and this quality parameter will be used as a base for generating the JPEG quantization tables. Note Occasionally, when encoding high entropy input data, such as random images, the encoding can fail if the quality parameter is set too high. This is due to the fact that the compressed bitstream would be larger than the input image. We recommend restarting the encoding with slightly lower quality factor or using a real-world images if possible. The parameters structure should be passed to compression functions. Note The encoding parameters structure can be reused to compress multiple images simultaneously, but no changes to the parameters should be made during the ongoing encoding, or the encoding result will be undefined. The user should create the encoding state structure using  nvjpegEncoderStateCreate()  function. This function will hold intermediate buffers for the encoding process. This state should be passed to the compression functions. Note The encoding state structure can be reused to encode a series of images, but no encoding should be performed on multiple images with the same encoding state at the same time—otherwise the result of the encodings will be undefined. The nvJPEG library provides a few interfaces for compressing the image in different formats and colorspaces. See below. Input for this function is an image in YUV colorspace. See  nvjpegEncodeYUV() . The  source  argument should be filled with the corresponding YUV planar data. The  chroma_subsampling  argument should have the chroma subsampling of the input data. If the chroma subsampling in the encoding parameters is the same as input chroma subsampling, then the user’s input data will be directly used in the JPEG compression. Otherwise chroma will be resampled to match the chroma subsampling of the encoding parameters. Input data should be provided with respect to the subsampling factors. That is, the chrominance image planes should have sizes aligned to the corresponding subsamplings. For example: Image dimensions: 123x321 Input chroma subsampling: NVJPEG_CSS_410 Chroma subsampling factor for this chroma subsampling: 4x2 Given the above, the encoder library expects the user to provide: Y plane with size: 123 x 321 Cb and Cr plane with size: 31 x 161 See  nvjpegEncodeImage() . Input for this function, i.e., how data should be provided in the  source  argument, is determined by the  input_format  argument. For the interleaved formats (ending with  I ) only the first channel is used. For the non-interleaved formats, all the channels in the input format are used. For example, if the user has interleaved the RGB image of size  W   x   H , stored continuously, and the pointer to it is  pImage , then  source  should be: source.channel[0]   =   pImage source.pitch[0]   =   W*3 When the same image is stored in planar format, with image planes pointers stored continuously in the array  pImage[3] , then  source  should be: source.channel[0]   =   pImage[0] source.channel[1]   =   pImage[1] source.channel[2]   =   pImage[2] The  pitch  values for each channel in the  source  parameter should be set accordingly to the data layout. The nvJPEG library will perform the color transformation to the YCbCr, and will compress the result. Often it is not feasible to accurately predict the final compressed data size of the final JPEG stream for any input data and parameters. The nvJPEG library, while encoding, will calculate the size of the final stream, allocate temporary buffer in the encoder state and save the compressed data in the encoding state’s buffer. In order to get final compressed JPEG stream, the user should provide the memory buffer large enough to store this compressed data. There are two options for how to do this: Use the upper bound on compressed JPEG stream size for the given parameters and image dimensions: Use the  nvjpegEncodeRetrieveBitstream()  function to retrieve the maximum possible JPEG stream size at any given time. Allocate the memory buffer at any given time. Encode the image using one of the encoding functions. Retrieve the compressed JPEG stream from the encoder state after successful encoding, using the  nvjpegEncodeRetrieveBitstream()  and the allocated buffer. Wait for the encoding to complete, and retrieve the exact size of required buffer, as below: Encode the image using one of the encoding functions. Use the  nvjpegEncodeRetrieveBitstream()  function to retrieve the size in bytes of the compressed JPEG stream. Allocate the memory buffer of at least this size. Use the  nvjpegEncodeRetrieveBitstream()  function to populate your buffer with the compressed JPEG stream. Note As the same encoding image state can be reused to compress a series of images, the  nvjpegEncodeRetrieveBitstream()  function will return the result for the last compressed image. See below the example code, and the block diagram shown in  Figure 1 , for encoding with nvJPEG Encoder.
