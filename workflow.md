web crawling: 
    cd /home/ubuntu/Steps/nvidia_docs/nvidia_docs/
    "$ scrapy runspider nvidia_docs_spider.py -o output.json" --> this will give the scraped data as a json document 
    checkout the formatting.ipynb for formatting the data, and chunking.ipynb for experiments regarding semantic chunking. It should be converted as a pipeline later on.
